    <string name="review_layout_review_text_tools">Leaving Terminator: Dark Fate, I never felt like they managed to save the franchise, nor overwhelmingly glad this movie exists.
        Its an adequate addition in a messy franchise that never reaches the heights of the first two films but is just above the three films before it, and because of this a lot of
        people will like it much more than they should. Its not the Halloween or even the X-Men: Days of Future Past of the Terminator franchise; its a fine follow up, and
        sadly nothing more.</string>
